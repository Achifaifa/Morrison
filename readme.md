mail and doorbell alert system

* When a letter enters the mailbox, it lights green leds in the board
* (WIP) When the doorbell is ringed, it increases the counter
* (WIP) Displays the total doorbell rings made since the last reset in a SMA420564 display
* Press the reset button to reset the mail and doorbell counters
* (WIP) Automatically reset the arduino when the mailbox is opened
* Send doorbell signals to the hackerspace so the ring can be played there

Future projects:

* Use a 12 key pad as input with a tone demodulator, and make each key make one sound (Hi #HSBXL!)
* Alternatively, a piano or any cool stuff with buttons will do
* Create an 'alerts' mailinglist and send alerts there
